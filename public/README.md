Project description: Local library 
Your neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. 
One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, 
and other general statistics about the program.  Other people are took care of the logistics and design, and I was tasked to build the algorithms.
